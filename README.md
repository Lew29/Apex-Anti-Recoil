# Apex-Anti-Recoil
## Changes
- Reorganised and removed some stuff
- Updated Patterns
- Removed everything to do with the gold optics aimbot
- Removed LStar and Hemlock from supply
- Fixed Alternator not having an "ALTERNATOR_PIXELS"
- Renamed Sella to Sheila, not sure why it was like this anyway
- Removed Wingman
- Added superglide macro, press and hold C with shift
- Added devo to supply for new season and updated the pattern

## Todo
- Change the weapon detection so it works not based on the colour of the ammo so supply drop weapons don't need to be moved back and forth each season
- Change prowler recoil so it follows the full pattern rather than just for the first burst
- Fix the issue with rapid-fire jamming
- Fix mastered weapons not detecting
- Better r99
