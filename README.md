# Apex-Anti-Recoil
## Changes
- Reorganised and removed some stuff
- Updated Patterns
- Removed everything to do with the gold optics aimbot
- Removed LStar and Hemlock from supply
- Fixed Alternator not having a "ALTERNATOR_PIXELS"
- Renamed Sella to Sheila not sure why it was like this anyways
- Removed Wingman
- Added superglide macro, press and hold C

## Todo
- Change the weapon detection so it works not based off of the colour of the ammo so supply drop weapons don't need to be moved back and forth
